# IOCs-Daily

So after 2 years collecting malware and generating IOCs, i've decided not to do it anymore, and no more IOCs will be added. The only major thing about these was the Richhashes and the Metahashes that would allow an analyst to pivot and find similar samples. But honestly, this is an unpaid job without much satisfaction and one that didn't much feedback, so - closing down. I'd rather just download samples from AAR rather than to scrape links myself. There were some payoff as i was able to send a zip file with +20k missing malware samples to abuse.ch though, dating back to 2018 which was before they started collecting malware.

Anyway, if you want to create richhashes and metahashes to corellate with, check these repositories for tools to make them yourself:
